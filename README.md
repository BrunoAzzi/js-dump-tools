The production version (master branch build) is runnig in http://js-dump-tools.herokuapp.com .

# Usage

To use this tools you will need some things:
- The Client Dump in `.csv` format;
- The Platform Dump;
- The JsonToCsvConverter;

### The Client Dump

The Client Dump can be found in the [integration page](http://integracao.chaordic.com.br/), or you can get it with the TAM.

If the client, or you download the dump file in a .xls or .xlsx format you can just open with [libreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/) and save as `.csv` file.

### The Platform Dump

You can get The Platform Dump in a bunch of ways, but the easyest is from [s3 web portal](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1#&bucket=platform-dumps-virginia&prefix=allBuyOrders/), you just need to sign in with your credentials.

Ok, if you clicked in the link above, now you are in `s3://platform-dumps-virginia/allBuyOrders/`, choose the latest date folder, and them download the <API_KEY>.gz (ex: carrodemola.gz) file that you want;

## The Future has come! ðŸ˜ƒ

Now you don't have to convert your platform dump to csv. Just click on the "JSON" tab when a platform dump is requested.

In the future will be a feature that just by selecting the client API_KEY the tool will download the platform dump for you, but for now you need to this by yourself;

### The real usage

Now just go to http://js-dump-tools.herokuapp.com and fill the forms as the tools asks.
